This game was developed during the internship at IITB, with the purpose of testing the gamification framework. This game is inspired by the classic Pac-Man game. The player is given a maths problem and 5 seconds time to solve that question. After the time ends, the player has to control the Pac-Man to reach to the correct answer ball. And of course escaping from the ghosts. The ghosts(two of four) follows the Pac-Man. It serches for the shortest path to Pac-Man. Play the game from link below (not for mobile).
