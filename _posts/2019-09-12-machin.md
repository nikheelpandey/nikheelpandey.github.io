The Sortobot project is aimed at the development of indigenous technology for sorting and grading of agro-commodities at an industrial scale. It uses computer vision to analyze the surface of instances of the commodities and uses machine learning for classification based on various user-selectable parameters such as the severity of the defect. With this project, we have developed a sorting machine that costs a fraction of the imported alternatives while at the same time has better accuracy, functionality, and flexibility that modern trade demands.
