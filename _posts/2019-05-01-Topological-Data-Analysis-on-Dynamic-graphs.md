Course project for Computational Geometry and Topology. Worked on TDA on time-varying graphs. Extracting persistence diagrams of each snapshot and comparing their paiwise Bottleneck/Wasserstein distances. Obtained a timeline plotting first dimension of classical MDS against time. This gave us the insight of the variations in the data over time. Also helps in finding one-time events. Used TDA libraries like: Gudhi, Dionysus 2, TDA package in R, etc.
