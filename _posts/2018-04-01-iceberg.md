In this project, I used custom CNN along with transfer learning to detect iceberg from satellite observations. I used 15 fold image augmentation to test the effects of data augmenation on satellite data. The score without image augmentation was 0.299 (2556th rank). After augmentation the score was 0.1571(400th rank). Couple of tweaks and optimazation may yet be needed to generate better result.
