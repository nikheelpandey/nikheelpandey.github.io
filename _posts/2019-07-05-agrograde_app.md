The Agrograde project brings the power of AI in the hands of marginalized farmers and small traders who are particularity vulnerable to consignment rejection and the resulting financial losses due to disputes over quality parameters of the vegetables and fruits. This app enables farmers to snap an image of randomly sampled instances of produce for quality analysis and grading. The computer vision algorithm does the state of the art instance segmentation and classifies each instance on the basis of size, color, and defect.
