A character-level LSTM implemented using PyTorch. Can generate random text. It was trained on Mark Twain's books. It learnt word spellings and use of words quite well. But doesn't produce very meaningful sentences. Just tried for fun, inspired by reading Andrej Karpathy's blog "<a href="https://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/">The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Networks</a>".
