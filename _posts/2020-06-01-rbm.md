Python implementation of Restricted Boltzmann Machine without using any high level library. Used numpy for efficient matrix computations. Used Contrastive Divergence for computing the gradient. Implemented gradient based optimization with momentum. Trained on MNIST data for demonstration of it's use. Check out the repository for more details.
