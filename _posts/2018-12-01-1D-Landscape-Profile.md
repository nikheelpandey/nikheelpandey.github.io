This was the Graphics and Visualization course project, which I took in my first semester of MTech at IISc, Bangalore. The aim was to construct a landscape profile for a given input augmented join tree. The join tree could have been extracted from 3D scalar field volume, 2D scalar field grid, clustering data, or any data from any other domain. Python was used for converting the input as a JSON file. d3.js javascript library was used for generating the intended landscape profile, as SVG on the browser. Aimed at visualization and analysis of high-dimensional data.
